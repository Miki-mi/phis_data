      <p><i><b>PhishNet</b></i> utilizes Machine Learning technology in to immediately recognize phishing behaviours in each website you visit. Your browsing history or personal information will not be logged or sent to a third-party.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4></h4>
      <h4>IP Address: </h4><p>An IP address is used instead of the domain name in the URL.<br>Example: http://125.98.3.123/fake.html</p>
      <h4>URL Length: </h4><p>Using a long URL to hide the doubtful part in the address bar. <br>Example: http://federmacedoadv.com.br/3f/aze/ab51e2e319e51502f416dbe46b773a5e/?cmd=_home&amp;dispatch=11004d58f5b74f8dc1e7c2e8dd4105e811004d58f5b74f8dc1e7c2e8dd4105e8@phishing.website.html</p>
      <h4>Tiny URL: </h4><p>Using URL Shortening Services to make URL considerably shorter in length. <br>Example: bit.ly/19DXSk4</p>
      <h4>@ Symbol: </h4><p>Using “@” symbol in the URL leads the browser to ignore everything preceding the “@” symbol and the real address often follows the “@” symbol.</p>
      <h4>// Redirect: </h4><p>The existence of “//” within the URL path means that the user will be redirected to another website. <br>Example: http://www.legitimate.com//http://www.phishing.com</p>
      <h4>- Prefix/Suffix: </h4><p>The dash symbol is rarely used in legitimate URLs. Phishers tend to add prefixes or suffixes separated by (-) to the domain name so that users feel that they are dealing with a legitimate webpage. <br>Example: http://www.Confirme-paypal.com/</p>
      <h4>Sub Domains: </h4><p>The number of sub domains the URL has.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS: </h4><p>Checks if domain uses HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol with Secure Sockets Layer)</p>
      <h4>Favicon: </h4><p>A favicon is a graphic image (icon) associated with a specific webpage. If the favicon is loaded from a domain other than that shown in the address bar, then the webpage is likely to be considered a Phishing attempt. </p>
      <h4>Port: </h4><p>It is much better to merely open ports that you need. If all ports are open, phishers can run almost any service they want and as a result, user information is threatened.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS in URL: </h4><p>The phishers may add “HTTPS” to the URL in order to trick users. For <br>Example: http://https-www-paypal-it-home.soft-hair.com/.</p>
      <h4>Request URL: </h4><p>Examines whether the external objects contained within a webpage such as images, videos and sounds are loaded from another domain.</p>
      <h4>SFH: </h4><p>Server Form Handlers (SFH) that contain an empty string or is different from the domain name of the webpage are considered doubtful.</p>
      <h4>Mail: </h4><p>Web form allows a user to submit their personal information that is directed to a server for processing. A phisher might redirect the user’s information to their personal email. </p>
      <h4>iFrames: </h4><p>iFrame is an HTML tag used to display an additional webpage into one that is currently shown. Phishers can make use of the “iframe” tag and make it invisible.</p>
